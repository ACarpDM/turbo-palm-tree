# X-Team 68 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will decide who is most interested and skilled in a certain task and assign from there. Tasks will be reaasigned if one doesn't feel 
confident in completed a task.


## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Set milestones to complete tasks incrementally and convene after each task is completed.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Communicate on discord and create an open communication environment to use within the group.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Meet frequently and keep track of tasks that need to be completed at these meetings.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Assign tasks in group meetings and follow up on previous tasks. Plan more meetings if needed.
